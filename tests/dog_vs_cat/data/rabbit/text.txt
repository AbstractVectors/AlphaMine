Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also contains the hares) of the order Lagomorpha (which also contains the pikas). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.
Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors.

Terminology and etymology
A male rabbit is called a buck; a female is called a doe.  An older term for an adult rabbit used until the 18th century is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young animals.[2] Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit.
A group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly refers to where the rabbits live).[3] A group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a litter[4] and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.[5]
The word rabbit itself derives from the Middle English rabet, a borrowing from the Walloon robète, which was a diminutive of the French or Middle Dutch robbe.[6]

Differences from hares
Main article: Hare
The term "rabbit" is typically used for all Leporidae species excluding the genus Lepus. Members of that genus are instead known as hares or jackrabbits.
Lepus species are typically precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while rabbit species are altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care. Hares live a relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the ground, while most rabbits live in social groups in burrows or warrens. Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are more elongated, and with hind legs that are larger and longer. Descendants of the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets, whereas no hares have been domesticated - the breed called the Belgian hare is actually a domestic rabbit which has been selectively bred to resemble a hare.

Domestication
Main article: Domestic rabbit
Rabbits have long been domesticated. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the European rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in ancient Rome. Selective breeding has generated a wide variety of rabbit breeds, of which many (since the early 19th century) are also kept as pets. Some strains of rabbit have been bred specifically as research subjects.
As livestock, rabbits are bred for their meat and fur. The earliest breeds were important sources of meat, and so became larger than wild rabbits, but domestic rabbits in modern times range in size from dwarf to giant. Rabbit fur, prized for its softness, can be found in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, as well as lengths. The Angora rabbit breed, for example, was developed for its long, silky fur, which is often hand-spun into yarn. Other domestic rabbit breeds have been developed primarily for the commercial fur trade, including the Rex, which has a short plush coat.

Biology
Evolution
 Development of the rabbit heart(wax models)
Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused.[7] Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. Recent DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they share a common lineage, so rabbits and rodents are now often grouped together in the superorder Glires.[8]

Morphology
 Skeleton of the rabbit
Since speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators (including the swift fox), rabbits have large hind leg bones and well developed musculature. Though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade posture. Rabbits use their strong claws for digging and (along with their teeth) for defense.[9] Each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw. Each hind foot has four toes (but no dewclaw).[10]  Melanistic coloringOryctologus cuniculusEuropean rabbit (wild)
Most wild rabbits (especially compared to hares) have relatively full, egg-shaped bodies. The soft coat of the wild rabbit is agouti in coloration (or, rarely, melanistic), which aids in camouflage. The tail of the rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail species) is dark on top and white below. Cottontails have white on the top of their tails.[11]
As a result of the position of the eyes in its skull, the rabbit has a field of vision that encompasses nearly 360 degrees, with just a small blind spot at the bridge of the nose.[12]

Hind limb elements
 This image comes from a specimen in the Pacific Lutheran University natural history collection. It displays all of the skeletal articulations of rabbit's hind limbs.
The anatomy of rabbits' hind limbs are structurally similar to that of other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of locomotion. The bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the tarsals). These bones are created through endochondral ossification during development. Like most land mammals, the round head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the os coxae. The femur articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the tibia. The tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes, commonly called the foot. The hind limbs of the rabbit are longer than the front limbs. This allows them to produce their hopping form of locomotion. Longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster speeds. Hares, which have longer legs than cottontail rabbits, are able to move considerably faster.[13] Rabbits stay just on their toes when moving; this is called Digitigrade locomotion. The hind feet have four long toes that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from spreading when hopping.[14] Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade locomotion. Instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.[15]

Musculature
 The rabbits hind limb (lateral view) includes muscles involved in the quadriceps and hamstrings.
Rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force, maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main parts; foot, thigh, and leg. The hind limbs of a rabbit are an exaggerated feature. They are much longer than the forelimbs, providing more force. Rabbits run on their toes to gain the optimal stride during locomotion. The force put out by the hind limbs is contributed to both the structural anatomy of the fusion tibia and fibula, and muscular features.[16] Bone formation and removal, from a cellular standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles. Action pressure from muscles creates force that is then distributed through the skeletal structures. Rabbits that generate less force, putting less stress on bones are more prone to osteoporosis due to bone rarefaction.[17] In rabbits, the more fibers in a muscle, the more resistant to fatigue. For example, hares have a greater resistance to fatigue than cottontails. The muscles of rabbit's hind limbs can be classified into four main categories: hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or plantar flexors. The quadriceps muscles are in charge of force production when jumping. Complementing these muscles are the hamstrings, which aid in short bursts of action. These muscles play off of one another in the same way as the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors, contributing to the generation and actions associated with force.[18]

Ears
 A Holland Lop resting with one ear up and one ear down. Some rabbits can adjust their ears to hear distant sounds.
Within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid predators. In the family Leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide. For example, in black tailed jack rabbits, their long ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that allow them to detect predators from far away. Contrasted to cotton tailed rabbits, their ears are smaller and shorter, requiring predators to be closer to detect them before they can flee. Evolution has favored rabbits having shorter ears so the larger surface area does not cause them to lose heat in more temperate regions. The opposite can be seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly because they possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that help with dispersion of heat as well as the theory that sound does not travel well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air. Therefore, longer ears are meant to aid the organism in detecting predators sooner rather than later in warmer temperatures.[19][page needed] The rabbit is characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by their longer ears.[20][page needed] Rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and detect predators due to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another. The ear muscles also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.[21]  Anatomy of mammalian ear
Outer ear
The auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit's outer ear.[22] The rabbit's pinnae represent a fair part of the body surface area. It is theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures above 30 °C with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due to this. Another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators, but this has typically only been seen in hares.[23][page needed] The rest of the outer ear has bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic membrane.[24]
Middle ear
The middle ear is filled with three bones called ossicles and is separated by the outer eardrum in the back of the rabbit's skull. The three ossicles are called hammer, anvil, and stirrup and act to decrease sound before it hits the inner ear. In general, the ossicles act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy.[24]
Inner ear
Inner ear fluid called endolymph receives the sound energy. After receiving the energy, later within the inner ear there are two parts: the cochlea that  utilizes sound waves from the ossicles and the vestibular apparatus that manages the rabbit's position in regards to movement. Within the cochlea there is a basilar membrane that contains sensory hair structures utilized to send nerve signals to the brain so it can recognize different sound frequencies. Within the vestibular apparatus the rabbit possesses three semicircular canals to help detect angular motion.[24]

Thermoregulation
Thermoregulation is the process that an organism utilizes to maintain an optimal body temperature independent of external conditions.[25] This process is carried out by the pinnae, which takes up most of the rabbit's body surface and contain a vascular network and arteriovenous shunts.[26] In a rabbit, the optimal body temperature is around 38.5–40℃.[27] If their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this optimal temperature, the rabbit must return to homeostasis. Homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by the use of their large, highly vascularized ears that are able to change the amount of blood flow that passes through the ears.   

 Rabbits use their large vascularized ears, which aid in thermoregulation, to keep their body temperature at an optimal level.
Constriction and dilation of blood vessels in the ears are used to control the core body temperature of a rabbit. If the core temperature exceeds its optimal temperature greatly, blood flow is constricted to limit the amount of blood going through the vessels. With this constriction, there is only a limited amount of blood that is passing through the ears where ambient heat would be able to heat the blood that is flowing through the ears and therefore, increasing the body temperature. Constriction is also used when the ambient temperature is much lower than that of the rabbit's core body temperature. When the ears are constricted it again limits blood flow through the ears to conserve the optimal body temperature of the rabbit. If the ambient temperature is either 15 degrees above or below the optimal body temperature, the blood vessels will dilate. With the blood vessels being enlarged, the blood is able to pass through the large surface area, causing it to either heat or cool down.
During hot summers, the rabbit has the capability to stretch its pinnae, which allows for greater surface area and increase heat dissipation. In cold winters, the rabbit does the opposite and folds its ears in order to decrease its surface area to the ambient air, which would decrease their body temperature.

The jackrabbit has the largest ears within the Oryctolagus cuniculus group. Their ears contribute to 17% of their total body surface area.  Their large pinna were evolved to maintain homeostasis while in the extreme temperatures of the desert.

Respiratory system
The rabbit's nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the two compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate.[28] The nasal cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a cartilage barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust before it can enter the respiratory tract.[28][29][page needed] As the rabbit breathes, air flows in through the nostrils along the alar folds. From there, the air moves into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down through the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs.[29][page needed][30] The larynx functions as the rabbit's voice box, which enables it to produce a wide variety of sounds.[29][page needed] The trachea is a long tube embedded with cartilaginous rings that prevent the tube from collapsing as air moves in and out of the lungs. The trachea then splits into a left and right bronchus, which meet the lungs at a structure called the hilum. From there, the bronchi split into progressively more narrow and numerous branches. The bronchi branch into bronchioles, into respiratory bronchioles, and ultimately terminate at the alveolar ducts. The branching that is typically found in rabbit lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which smaller branches divide out laterally from a larger central branch.[31]
The structure of the rabbit's nasal and oral cavities, necessitates breathing through the nose. This is due to the fact that the epiglottis is fixed to the backmost portion of the soft palate.[30] Within the oral cavity, a layer of tissue sits over the opening of the glottis, which blocks airflow from the oral cavity to the trachea.[28]  The epiglottis functions to prevent the rabbit from aspirating on its food. Further, the presence of a soft and hard palate allow the rabbit to breathe through its nose while it feeds.[29][page needed]

 Monopodial branching as seen in dissected rabbit lungs.
Rabbits lungs are divided into four lobes: the cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory lobes. The right lung is made up of all four lobes, while the left lung only has two: the cranial and caudal lobes.[31] In order to provide space for the heart, the left cranial lobe of the lungs is significantly smaller than that of the right.[28] The diaphragm is a muscular structure that lies caudal to the lungs and contracts to facilitate respiration.[28][30]

Digestion
Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass and other leafy plants. In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem via a form of hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs or "night droppings" [32] and are immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.[33]
Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding.[citation needed] In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested.[citation needed] If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals.[citation needed] While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced.[citation needed]

 Video of a wild European rabbit with ears twitching and a jump
Hard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant cuticle and stalk, being the final waste product after redigestion of soft pellets. These are only released outside the burrow and are not reingested. Soft pellets are usually produced several hours after grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted.[citation needed] They are made up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell walls.[citation needed]
Rabbits are hindgut digesters. This means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum. In rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract.[34] The unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope. Cecotropes, sometimes called "night feces", are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health. Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines. This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food.[35]
The chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. The pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being 24.4% protein on average. The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces. After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat.[11] This process serves the same purpose in the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and sheep.[36]

Because rabbits cannot vomit,[37] if buildup occurs within the intestines (due often to a diet with insufficient fibre),[38] intestinal blockage can occur.[39]

Reproduction
 Diagram of the male rabbit reproductive system with main components labeled.
The adult male reproductive system forms the same as most mammals with the seminiferous tubular compartment containing the Sertoli cells and an adluminal compartment that contains the Leydig cells.[40] The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which maintains libido[40] and creates secondary sex characteristics such as the genital tubercle and penis. The Sertoli cells triggers the production of Anti-Müllerian duct hormone, which absorbs the Müllerian duct. In an adult male rabbit, the sheath of the penis is cylinder-like and can be extruded as early as two months of age.[41] The scrotal sacs lay lateral to the penis and contain epididymal fat pads which protect the testes. Between 10 and 14 weeks, the testes descend and are able to retract into the pelvic cavity in order to thermoregulate.[41] Furthermore, the secondary sex characteristics, such as the testes, are complex and secrete many compounds. These compounds includes fructose, citric acid, minerals, and a uniquely high amount of catalase.[40]

 Diagram of the female rabbit reproductive system with main components labeled.
The adult female reproductive tract is bipartite, which prevents an embryo from translocating between uteri.[42] The two uterine horns communicate to two cervixes and forms one vaginal canal. Along with being bipartite, the female rabbit does not go through an estrus cycle, which causes mating induced ovulation.[41]
The average female rabbit becomes sexually mature at three to eight months of age and can conceive at any time of the year for the duration of her life. Egg and sperm production can begin to decline after three years.[40] During mating, the male rabbit will mount the female rabbit from behind and insert his penis into the female and make rapid pelvic hip thrusts. The encounter lasts only 20–40 seconds and after, the male will throw himself backwards off the female.[43]
The rabbit gestation period is short and ranges from 28 to 36 days with an average period of 31 days. A longer gestation period will generally yield a smaller litter while shorter gestation periods will give birth to a larger litter. The size of a single litter can range from four to 12 kits allowing a female to deliver up to 60 new kits a year. After birth, the female can become pregnant again as early as the next day.[41]
The mortality rates of embryos are high in rabbits and can be due to infection, trauma, poor nutrition and environmental stress so a high fertility rate is necessary to counter this.[41]

Sleep
Further information: Sleep (non-human)
Rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural inclination is toward nocturnal activity.[44] In 2011, the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day.[45] As with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger.[46]


Diseases and immunity
See also: Category:Rabbit diseases
In addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Escherichia coli, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses RHD ("rabbit hemorrhagic disease", a form of calicivirus)[47] or myxomatosis. Among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms (such as Taenia serialis), external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, and Toxoplasma gondii.[48][49] Domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis.[50] Rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.[51]
Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite is also capable of infecting many mammals including rabbits.
Rabbit immunity has significantly diverged from other tetrapods in the manner it employs immunoglobulin light chains.[52][53] In one case McCartney-Francis et al., 1984 discover a unique additional disulfide bond between Cys 80 in Vκ and Cys 171 in Cκ.[52][53] They suggest that this may serve to stabilise rabbit antibodies.[52][53] Meanwhile IGKC1 shows high amino acid divergence between domesticated types and ferals derived from them.[53] This can be as high as 40%.[53]
Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) including type 2 (RHDV2).[54] RHDV2 was detected for the first time in Washington state, USA in May 2022 and then in August once in Washington and twice in Oregon.[55]

Ecology
 Rabbit kits one hour after birth
Rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings. For instance, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes.[56] If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground. Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning.[57]  The doe (mother) is aware that she gives off scent which can attract predators, so she will stay away from the nest to avoid putting the kits (babies) in danger, returning the nest only a few times a day to feed the kits.[58]
Rabbits survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs. Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle.[59] The longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania, died at age 18.[60] The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.[61]

Habitat and range
Rabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts and wetlands.[62] Rabbits live in groups, and the best known species, the European rabbit, lives in burrows, or rabbit holes. A group of burrows is called a warren.[62]
More than half the world's rabbit population resides in North America.[62] They are also native to southwestern Europe, Southeast Asia, Sumatra, some islands of Japan, and in parts of Africa and South America. They are not naturally found in most of Eurasia, where a number of species of hares are present. Rabbits first entered South America relatively recently, as part of the Great American Interchange. Much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the tapeti, while most of South America's southern cone is without rabbits.
The European rabbit has been introduced to many places around the world.[11]

Environmental problems

 Impact of rabbit-proof fence, Cobar, New South Wales, 1905
Rabbits have been a source of environmental problems when introduced into the wild by humans. As a result of their appetites, and the rate at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be problematic for agriculture. Gassing (fumigation of warrens),[64] barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and ferreting have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are diseases such as myxomatosis (myxo or mixi, colloquially) and calicivirus. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus. The virus was developed in Spain, and is beneficial to rabbit farmers. If it were to make its way into wild populations in areas such as Australia, it could create a population boom, as those diseases are the most serious threats to rabbit survival. Rabbits in Australia and New Zealand are considered to be such a pest that land owners are legally obliged to control them.[65][66]

 Rabbit being prepared in the kitchenSimulation of daily life, mid-15th centuryHospices de Beaune, FranceIn some areas, wild rabbits and hares are hunted for their meat, a lean source of high quality protein.[67] In the wild, such hunting is accomplished with the aid of trained falcons, ferrets, or dogs, as well as with snares or other traps, and rifles. A caught rabbit may be dispatched with a sharp blow to the back of its head, a practice from which the term rabbit punch is derived.
Wild leporids comprise a small portion of global rabbit-meat consumption. Domesticated descendants of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that are bred and kept as livestock (a practice called cuniculture) account for the estimated 200 million tons of rabbit meat produced annually.[68] Approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[69] In 1994, the countries with the highest consumption per capita of rabbit meat were Malta with 8.89 kg (19 lb 10 oz), Italy with 5.71 kg (12 lb 9 oz), and Cyprus with 4.37 kg (9 lb 10 oz), falling to 0.03 kg (1 oz) in Japan. The figure for the United States was 0.14 kg (5 oz) per capita. The largest producers of rabbit meat in 1994 were China, Russia, Italy, France, and Spain.[70] Rabbit meat was once a common commodity in Sydney, Australia, but declined after the myxomatosis virus was intentionally introduced to control the exploding population of feral rabbits in the area.
In the United Kingdom, fresh rabbit is sold in butcher shops and markets, and some supermarkets sell frozen rabbit meat. At farmers markets there, including the famous Borough Market in London, rabbit carcasses are sometimes displayed hanging, unbutchered (in the traditional style), next to braces of pheasant or other small game. Rabbit meat is a feature of Moroccan cuisine, where it is cooked in a tajine with "raisins and grilled almonds added a few minutes before serving".[71] In China, rabbit meat is particularly popular in Sichuan cuisine, with its stewed rabbit, spicy diced rabbit, BBQ-style rabbit, and even spicy rabbit heads, which have been compared to spicy duck neck.[68] Rabbit meat is comparatively unpopular elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific.
An extremely rare infection associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as rabbit fever), which may be contracted from an infected rabbit.[72] Hunters are at higher risk for tularemia because of the potential for inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process.
In addition to their meat, rabbits are used for their wool, fur, and pelts, as well as their nitrogen-rich manure and their high-protein milk.[73] Production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as the well-known Angora rabbit) to efficiently fill these needs.

In art, literature, and culture


Main article: Rabbits and hares in art
Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny. The species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the Velveteen Rabbit, or Thumper in Bambi).
With its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the Playboy Bunny. The rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized (for example) by the marketing icons the Energizer Bunny and the Duracell Bunny.

The rabbit often appears in folklore as the trickster archetype, as he uses his cunning to outwit his enemies.

In Aztec mythology, a pantheon of four hundred rabbit gods known as Centzon Totochtin, led by Ometochtli or Two Rabbit, represented fertility, parties, and drunkenness.
In Central Africa, the common hare (Kalulu), is "inevitably described" as a trickster figure.[74]
In Chinese folklore, rabbits accompany Chang'e on the Moon. In the Chinese New Year, the zodiacal rabbit is one of the twelve celestial animals in the Chinese zodiac. Note that the Vietnamese zodiac includes a zodiacal cat in place of the rabbit, possibly because rabbits did not inhabit Vietnam.[citation needed] The most common explanation is that the ancient Vietnamese word for "rabbit" (mao) sounds like the Chinese word for "cat" (卯, mao).[75]
In Japanese tradition, rabbits live on the Moon where they make mochi, the popular snack of mashed sticky rice. This comes from interpreting the pattern of dark patches on the moon as a rabbit standing on tiptoes on the left pounding on an usu, a Japanese mortar.
In Jewish folklore, rabbits (shfanim שפנים) are associated with cowardice, a usage still current in contemporary Israeli spoken Hebrew (similar to the English colloquial use of "chicken" to denote cowardice).
In Korean mythology, as in Japanese, rabbits live on the moon making rice cakes ("Tteok" in Korean).
In Anishinaabe traditional beliefs, held by the Ojibwe and some other Native American peoples, Nanabozho, or Great Rabbit, is an important deity related to the creation of the world.
A Vietnamese mythological story portrays the rabbit of innocence and youthfulness. The Gods of the myth are shown to be hunting and killing rabbits to show off their power.
Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism have associations with an ancient circular motif called the three rabbits (or "three hares"). Its meaning ranges from "peace and tranquility", to purity or the Holy Trinity, to Kabbalistic levels of the soul or to the Jewish diaspora.  The tripartite symbol also appears in heraldry and even tattoos.
The rabbit as trickster is a part of American popular culture, as Br'er Rabbit (from African-American folktales and, later, Disney animation) and Bugs Bunny (the cartoon character from Warner Bros.), for example.
Anthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in film and literature, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (the White Rabbit and the March Hare characters), in Watership Down (including the film and television adaptations), in Rabbit Hill (by Robert Lawson), and in the Peter Rabbit stories (by Beatrix Potter).  In the 1920s, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, was a popular cartoon character.

A rabbit's foot may be carried as an amulet, believed to bring protection and good luck. This belief is found in many parts of the world, with the earliest use being recorded in Europe c. 600 BC.[76]
On the Isle of Portland in Dorset, UK, the rabbit is said to be unlucky and even speaking the creature's name can cause upset among older island residents. This is thought to date back to early times in the local quarrying industry where (to save space) extracted stones that were not fit for sale were set aside in what became tall, unstable walls. The local rabbits' tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls and their collapse resulted in injuries or even death. Thus, invoking the name of the culprit became an unlucky act to be avoided. In the local culture to this day, the rabbit (when he has to be referred to) may instead be called a “long ears” or “underground mutton”, so as not to risk bringing a downfall upon oneself.[77] While it was true 50 years ago[when?] that a pub on the island could be emptied by calling out the word "rabbit", this has become more fable than fact in modern times.[citation needed]
In other parts of Britain and in North America, invoking the rabbit's name may instead bring good luck. "Rabbit rabbit rabbit" is one variant of an apotropaic or talismanic superstition that involves saying or repeating the word "rabbit" (or "rabbits" or "white rabbits" or some combination thereof) out loud upon waking on the first day of each month, because doing so will ensure good fortune for the duration of that month.
The "rabbit test" is a term, first used in 1949, for the Friedman test, an early diagnostic tool for detecting a pregnancy in humans. It is a common misconception (or perhaps an urban legend) that the test-rabbit would die if the woman was pregnant. This led to the phrase "the rabbit died" becoming a euphemism for a positive pregnancy test.

eastern cottontail rabbitrabbit,  any of 29 species of long-eared mammals belonging to the family Leporidae, excluding hares (genus Lepus).cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus)Frequently the terms rabbit and hare are used interchangeably, a practice that can cause confusion. Jackrabbits, for instance, are actually hares, whereas the rockhares and the hispid hare are rabbits. Rabbits differ from hares in size, life history, and preferred habitat. In general, rabbits are smaller and have shorter ears than hares. They are born without fur and with closed eyes after a gestation period of 30–31 days. They prefer habitats composed of trees and shrubs, where they live in burrows dug into the soil. Hares, in contrast, are larger in size, and they are born fully developed with fur and open eyes after a gestation period lasting about 42 days. They prefer open areas such as prairies, where they make their nests in small open depressions.Explore the key differences between rabbits and haresSee all videos for this articleRabbits are ground dwellers that live in environments ranging from desert to tropical forest and wetland. Their natural geographic range in the Western Hemisphere encompasses the middle latitudes. In the Eastern Hemisphere rabbits are found in Europe, portions of Central and Southern Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Sumatra, and Japan. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been introduced to many locations around the world, and all breeds of domestic rabbit originate from the European. Nearly half of the world’s rabbit species are in danger of extinction; many are among the most vulnerable of all mammals.The long ears of rabbits are most likely an adaptation for detecting predators. In addition to their prominent ears, which can measure up to 6 cm (more than 2 inches) long, rabbits have long, powerful hind legs and a short tail. Each foot has five digits (one reduced); rabbits move about on the tips of the digits in a fashion known as digitigrade locomotion. Full-bodied and egg-shaped, wild rabbits are rather uniform in body proportions and stance. The smallest is the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), at only 20 cm (7.9 inches) in length and 0.4 kg (0.9 pound) in weight, while the largest grow to 50 cm (19.7 inches) and more than 2 kg (4.4 pounds). The fur is generally long and soft, and its colour ranges through shades of brown, gray, and buff. Exceptions are the black Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi) of Japan and two black-striped species from Southeast Asia. The tail is usually a small puff of fur, generally brownish but white on top in the cottontails (genus Sylvilagus) of North and South America.

 Natural history While the European rabbit is the best-known species, it is probably also the least typical, as there is considerable variability in the natural history of rabbits. Many rabbits dig burrows, but cottontails and hispid hares do not. The European rabbit constructs the most extensive burrow systems, called warrens. Nonburrowing rabbits make surface nests called forms, generally under dense protective cover. The European rabbit occupies open landscapes such as fields, parks, and gardens, although it has colonized habitats from stony deserts to subalpine valleys. It is the most social rabbit, sometimes forming groups in warrens of up to 20 individuals. However, even in European rabbits social behaviour can be quite flexible, depending on habitat and other local conditions, so that at times the primary social unit is a territorial breeding pair. Most rabbits are relatively solitary and sometimes territorial, coming together only to breed or occasionally to forage in small groups. During territorial disputes rabbits will sometimes “box,” using their front limbs. Rabbits are active throughout the year; no species is known to hibernate. Rabbits are generally nocturnal, and they also are relatively silent. Other than loud screams when frightened or caught by a predator, the only auditory signal known for most species is a loud foot thump made to indicate alarm or aggression. A notable exception is the volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi) of Mexico, which utters a variety of calls. rabbit skeletonInstead of sound, scent seems to play a predominant role in the communication systems of most rabbits; they possess well-developed glands throughout their body and rub them on fixed objects to convey group identity, sex, age, social and reproductive status, and territory ownership. Urine is also used in chemical communication (see animal communication). When danger is perceived, the general tendency of rabbits is to freeze and hide under cover. If chased by a predator, they engage in quick, irregular movement, designed more to evade and confuse than to outdistance a pursuer. Skeletal adaptations such as long hind limbs and a strengthened pelvic girdle enable their agility and speed (up to 80 km [50 miles] per hour).

 Rabbits must consume plant material in large quantities to ensure proper nutrition, and thus they have large digestive tracts. Their diet, consisting primarily of grasses and forbs (herbs other than grasses), contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem by passing two distinctive types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are immediately eaten (see coprophagy). Chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that aid in the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces. After being excreted, they are eaten by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach. This double-digestion process enables rabbits to utilize nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat. Most rabbits produce many offspring (kittens) each year, although scarcity of resources may cause this potential to be suppressed. A combination of factors allows the high rates of reproduction commonly associated with rabbits. Rabbits generally are able to breed at a young age, and many regularly conceive litters of up to seven young, often doing so four or five times a year. In addition, females (does) exhibit induced ovulation, their ovaries releasing eggs in response to copulation rather than according to a regular cycle. They can also undergo postpartum estrus, conceiving immediately after a litter has been born. Newborn rabbits are naked, blind, and helpless at birth (altricial). Mothers are remarkably inattentive to their young and are almost absentee parents, commonly nursing their young only once per day and for just a few minutes. To overcome this lack of attention, the milk of rabbits is highly nutritious and among the richest of all mammals’ milk. The young grow rapidly, and most are weaned in about a month. Males (bucks) do not assist in rearing the kittens. Both wild and domestic rabbits are of economic importance to people. Wild lagomorphs are popular with hunters for sport as well as for food and fur. Rabbit meat, known for its delicate flavor, remains an important source of protein in many cultures. Domestic rabbits are raised for meat and skins, the latter being used as pelts and for making felt. The timing of rabbit domestication is a matter of some debate. Fossil and archaeological records suggest that wild rabbits have been hunted for meat and furs since the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million years to 11,700 years ago). The oldest historical record of rabbits being kept as livestock appears in the writings of Roman author and satirist Marcus Terentius Varro in the 1st century bce. Fossil records and other evidence also suggest that rabbits were delivered on ships to several islands in the Mediterranean (such as the Balearic Islands by the 14th century bce, Malta by the 3rd century ce, and the islands of the eastern Mediterranean by the Middle Ages). A comparison of the genomes (the entire set of chromosomes and their genes) of domesticated European rabbits and their wild counterparts in France suggests that the two groups became effectively isolated from one another between 17,700 and 12,200 years ago, possibly in connection with the retreat of continental ice sheets and mountain glaciers in southwestern Europe during this time. The combination of fossil and written records and DNA analysis points to rabbit domestication originating sometime between the retreat of the ice sheets and the 1st century bce in southwestern Europe. Studies suggest that the process of rabbit domestication occurred over hundreds if not thousands of years, because it depended upon a number of natural and human-driven factors acting together rather than a single discrete event. Nevertheless, a legend persists—popular though untrue—that European rabbits became domesticated about 600 ce after monks from southern France bred them for meat because the Roman Catholic Church supposedly allowed the flesh of young rabbits to be consumed during Lent. Today there are more than 50 established strains of domestic rabbits, all selectively bred from this one species. Their attractive appearance and quiet manner have made domestic rabbits good and relatively undemanding pets. Because they are easily raised in captivity, rabbits are also important as laboratory animals for medical and scientific purposes. However, rabbits may also carry and transmit to humans diseases such as tularemia, or rabbit fever.
 Because of their frequent local abundance, rabbits (and hares) are important in many terrestrial food chains. They are preyed upon by a wide variety of mammals and birds that rely upon them as dietary staples. Wolves, foxes, bobcats, weasels, hawks, eagles, and owls all take their toll. Rabbits can also exert profound influence on native and cultivated vegetation, which causes them to be considered pests in some circumstances. Extreme examples have occurred where the European rabbit has been introduced. Wild European rabbits were introduced to Australia in 1859, and within 10 years they were causing extensive agricultural damage, prompting the development of a series of largely ineffective rabbit-proof fences in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to keep rabbits in the eastern parts of Australia from invading the western regions. Early rates of spread were phenomenal (up to 350 km [220 miles] per year), and within 60 years the southern half of the continent had been occupied, with widespread damage to crops and decreases—even extinctions—of native Australian flora and fauna the result. Attempts to control the rabbit have been largely futile. For instance, a viral disease (myxomatosis) naturally existing in certain South American cottontails was found to be lethal to European rabbits. The virus was introduced to the Australian population during the early 1950s, and, although the initial wave of infection killed nearly all rabbits in Australia (99 percent), subsequent waves proved to be less effective, as the rabbits quickly developed immunity and the virus became less virulent. Ongoing research in Australia continues to seek biological solutions (including the introduction of rabbit hemorrhagic disease and other diseases and parasites)—in addition to poisoning, fumigation, hunting, and warren destruction—for controlling the rabbit population.

Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and distinctive long ears. There 29 species around the world, according to Nature by PBS (opens in new tab) and, while they live in many different environments, they have many things in common.Rabbits and hares are in the same taxonomic family, Leporidae, but they are in different genera. There are 11 genera within the family, but the term “true hares” refers only to species in the genus Lepus; all others are rabbits. Also, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) (opens in new tab) recognizes 49 rabbit breeds.How big are rabbits?Some rabbits are about the size of a cat, and some can grow to be as big as a small child. Small rabbits, such as pygmy rabbits, can be as little as 9.3 inches (24 centimeters) in length and weigh less than a pound, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (opens in new tab). Larger species grow to 20 inches (50 cm) and more than 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms). Related articles—What's the difference between rabbits and hares?—Are jackalopes real?—10 times nature stunned us in 2021 According to the Journal of Applied Animal Research (opens in new tab), the Flemish Giant is the largest rabbit breed in the world. The average weight of the Flemish Giant is 25 lbs (11 kg), according to World Atlas (opens in new tab). Other large rabbit species include the Continental Giant at 16 lbs (7 kg) and the Blanc De Bouscat at 15 lbs (6 kg).   . The world's longest individual rabbit, according to Guinness World Records (opens in new tab), is a Flemish giant that clocked in at 4 feet 3 inches (129 cm) and 49 pounds (22 kg).Small rabbit breeds include the Britannia Petite, under 2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg); Netherland dwarf, under 2.5 lbs.; dwarf hotot, under 3 lbs. (1.3 kg); and Himalayan, 2.5 to 4.5 lbs. (1.1 to 2 kg).A giant continental rabbit, aged 10 months. (Image credit: Getty Images)Rabbit reproductionRabbits are known for their insatiable reproductive habits for good reason. They breed three to four times each year. This is because only 15 percent of baby rabbits make it to their first birthday, according to the Animal Diversity Web (ADW) (opens in new tab). So, to ensure that the population grows, rabbits have more babies. According to the Wildlife Center of Virginia (opens in new tab), in each pregnancy a female rabbit produces between one and twelve babies, called kittens or kits. However, the average number is five. After around three  weeks, a kit can care for itself, according to the Wildlife Center of Virginia. In two or three months it is ready to start a family of its own. If there is a lack of natural predators, an area can quickly become overrun with rabbits.What do rabbits eat? Rabbits are herbivores, according to the Journal of Mammalogy (opens in new tab). This means that they have a plant-based diet and do not eat meat. Their diets include grasses, clover and some cruciferous plants, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. They are opportunistic feeders, according to the University of Missouri (opens in new tab), and so also eat fruits, seeds, roots, buds, and tree bark.Where do they live?While originally from Europe and Africa, rabbits are now found all over the world. Wild rabbits occupy most of the world’s continents, except for Asia and Antarctica, according to ADW (opens in new tab). Although originally absent from many countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, rabbits have been introduced to these locations during the last few centuries, according to the journal Mammal Review (opens in new tab).Rabbit burrows can be found at Okunoshima Island, Japan. (Image credit: Getty Images)Domestic rabbits need a regulated environment to protect against heat exhaustion or hypothermia. Wild rabbits don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands. Wild rabbits create their own homes by tunneling into the ground. These tunnel systems are called warrens and include rooms for nesting and sleeping. They also have multiple entrances for quick escape. Warrens can be as deep as 9.84 feet (3 meters) underground, according to the Textbook of Rabbit Medicine (opens in new tab).Rabbits’ habitsRabbits are very social creatures and live in large groups called colonies. The busiest time of day for rabbits is at dusk and dawn, according to the Proceedings of the 8th World Rabbit Congress (opens in new tab). This is when they venture out to find food. The low light allows them to hide from predators. Predators — which include owls, hawks, eagles, falcons, wild dogs, feral cats and ground squirrels — are a constant threat. The rabbit’s long legs and ability to run for long periods at high speeds are likely evolutionary adaptations to help them elude things that want to eat them.Classification/ taxonomyThis is the taxonomy of rabbits, according to ADW, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS):Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Class: Mammalia Order: Lagomorpha Family: Leporidae Genera: Brachylagus (pygmy rabbits)Bunolagus (riverine rabbits)Nesolagus (Sumatran rabbits, Annamite striped rabbits)Oryctolagus (Old World rabbits, European rabbits, domestic rabbits)Pentalagus (Amami rabbits)Poelagus (Bunyoro rabbits)Romerolagus (volcano rabbits)Sylvilagus (cottontail rabbits)Species: There are more than 50 species of rabbits. The domestic rabbit is Oryctolagus cuniculus.Conservation statusThe European rabbit is 'near threatened'.  (Image credit: Getty Images)The domestic or European rabbit is considered within near threatened range by the IUCN (opens in new tab). Found all over the world, scientists think most populations are descendants of domestic rabbits that were released in the wild. According to the Encyclopedia of Immunobiology (opens in new tab), it is native to the Iberian Peninsula, and in that area, populations have declined as much as 95 percent from its 1950 numbers, and about 80 percent of its 1975 numbers. The decline is attributed to habitat loss, disease and hunting. Rabbits are considered pests by many gardeners.Bunolagus monticularis, the riverine rabbit of South Africa, is critically endangered, according to the IUCN (opens in new tab). Of 10 subpopulations, none is estimated to have more than 50 individuals, according to the IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species. Loss of habitat is the main threat.Nesolagus netscheri, the Sumatran striped rabbit, is listed by the IUCN (opens in new tab) as vulnerable. It is a rare species, according to IUCN, and not well known locally. The species lives only on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, at altitudes between 600 and 1,600 m (1,969 and 5,249 feet).Pentalagus furnessi (Amami rabbit), which is found only on two Japanese islands, is endangered, according to the IUCN (opens in new tab). Populations are declining because of invasive predators and habitat loss caused by forest clearing and resort construction. There are only about 5,000 individuals alive on Amami Island and 400 on Tokuno Island.Romerolagus diazi (Volcano rabbit) is listed as endangered. It is found only in Mexico near the volcanoes Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, El Pelado and Tlaloc. A 1994 study in the Journal of Mammalogy (opens in new tab) found between 2,478 and 12,120 individuals, but the population trend is increasing.Several species of cottontail rabbits (genus Silvilagus) are listed as near threatened, threatened, vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered. The San José brush rabbit (opens in new tab) (Silvilagus mansuetus) is found only on San José Island in the Gulf of California. The one population occupies an area of about 20 square kilometers (7.7 square miles). Fewer individuals were observed in 2008 compared to studies in 1995 and 1996, although quantities were recorded.Other factsRabbits' speed and senses of smell, sight and hearing help them to avoid danger. (Image credit: Getty Images)Rabbits can be very crafty and quick. To get away from a predator, a cottontail rabbit will run in a zigzag pattern and reach speeds of up to 18 mph (29 km/h), according to Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources at the University of Georgia (opens in new tab). Their ears can grow to 4 inches (10 cm), according to PDSA (opens in new tab). This stretched-out length allows them to better hear predators that may be approaching. It also allows them to stay cool in hot climates. Extra body heat is released through blood vessels in the ear, according to the Biomimicry Institute (opens in new tab).Their eyes are made for safety, too, since each eye can rotate almost 360 degrees, according to North American Nature (opens in new tab). This allows them to look behind them without turning their heads.Rabbits don't get a lot of nourishment from their diet. They often eat their own excrement to access any remaining nourishment that their digestive system may have missed the first time, according to the book Nutrition of the Rabbit (opens in new tab).Additional resourcesTo read more about why rabbits were introduced to Australia, go to the National Museum Australia website (opens in new tab).

68 Interesting Rabbit Facts That You Will Love To Know

By Editorial Staff 



Last updated on September 5th, 2022With distinctive long ears, and short tails, rabbits are small mammals that are found on all continents expect Antarctica. There are 29 species of rabbits. With these interesting facts about rabbits, let us learn about their physical features, feeding habits, reproduction, behaviour, and more.


Table of Contents

Physical FeaturesFeeding HabitsReproductionCharacteristicsUnique BehaviorsRabbit TriviaFamous Rabbits
Physical Features
1. Size and Weight
Rabbits are small mammals with long ears and powerful hind legs. Most rabbits are between 13 and 20 inches long. Adults weigh between 2.4 and 5.5 pounds.
2. Exceptional Jumpers
Rabbits can easily jump over 2 feet high. The best of them, Mimrelunds Tosen of Denmark, was able to jump over 3 feet (39.2 inches) for the world record.
3. Panoramic Vision
Rabbits use their nearly 360° panoramic vision to effectively avoid predators in the wild. Their only blind spot is a small section in front of their nose. They can see far objects better than nearby objects.
4. Sense of Smell
A rabbit’s sense of smell is even better than their eyesight. They are likely to smell the presence of a predator before they see it.

5. Sound Detection
Rabbits have ears that can grow up to 10 centimeters! Rabbit ears can move independently by 180 degrees, enabling them to hear from two directions at once. They can detect sounds from far away, including high frequencies that humans can’t hear.
6. Rabbit Lifespan
A pet rabbit can live for about 5 to 10 years depending on the breed. Sterilized rabbits, referring to those who are spayed or neutered, can often live up to 12 years.
7. Rabbit Speed
Cottontail rabbits can run at a speed of 18 miles per hour (29kph). They move in a zigzag pattern to confuse their predators and make themselves harder to catch.
8. Rabbits vs Hares
These belong to the same family but are different species. Hares tend to have larger bodies and longer ears. They are also less social than rabbits and live completely aboveground.

9. Rabbit Tails
Rabbits have small but functional tails. These are used to distract predators during a chase and to signal danger to other rabbits. They can also use their tails to communicate emotion.
10. Largest Rabbit
The largest rabbit of all time comes from Minorca in Spain. Nuralagus Rex existed 3-5 million years ago based on the fossil records. Average weight is 12 kg, but some are as heavy as 23 kg.
11. Longest Rabbit Fur
Franchesca the Rabbit has the longest fur on record at 14.37 inches (36.5 cm). Her owner is an expert on the breed called English Angora rabbit, which is often mistaken for Pekingese dogs.

Feeding Habits
12. Expelling Food
Humans and some other animals can puke out anything that upsets their stomach. However, rabbits are not able to vomit food, so they must be careful about what they eat.
13. Herbivore Diet
Rabbits eat hay, grass, and other plants. They need a steady supply to stay healthy and full of energy. Pet owners can supplement this with rabbit pellets, vegetables, and fruits.
14. Digestive System
Rabbits and horses have similar digestive systems. They both have an organ called the cecum at the end of the tract. This is filled with microbes that break down the food fibers. Rabbits can’t fully digest their fiber-rich food in one pass. It might be hard to imagine, but they eat their own soft poop pellets to digest them a second time and properly absorb the nutrients.
15. High-speed Chewing
Rabbits can chew 120 times a minute, allowing them to partially break down their food quickly before this goes into their stomach.

16. Rabbits and Carrots
Rabbits are often portrayed as carrot-loving animals but they can’t live on these alone. Only small amounts are recommended because carrots are high on natural sugars that can cause tooth decay in rabbits.
17. Careful Consumers
Before grazing in the open, rabbits survey the area and formulate an exit strategy. They may seem preoccupied with food but they are always monitoring. At the first sign of danger, they will dash towards a predetermined path.
18. Crepuscular Creatures
Just like house cats and deer, rabbits are crepuscular creatures. This means that they are most active during twilight hours: dusk and dawn. They spend most of the day sleeping. It may not always be obvious because rabbits can sleep with their eyes open for faster response to danger.

19. Longest Rabbit
The world’s longest rabbit is “Darius”, a Continental Giant from the UK measuring 4 feet and 3 inches long. It weighs just over 50 pounds from an annual diet that includes 700 apples and 2,000 carrots.
20. Rabbit Teeth
Their teeth never stop growing. In the wild, their penchant for chewing on barks and branches keep these short. In captivity, they can chew on hay, wooden blocks, or chew toys to get the same effect.
Reproduction
21. Rabbit Terms
A female rabbit is called a doe, while a male is called a buck — just like deer. A baby rabbit is referred to as a kit. When discussing a group of rabbits, call them a herd.
22. Rabbit Litter
Rabbits have a short pregnancy that lasts for only 30 days. After this, an average female will give birth to a litter of 4 to 12 babies.

23. Babies at Birth
Rabbits are born blind and naked. They remain in a fur-lined nest during the first few days for warmth. On the other hand, hares are born with open eyes and body hair. They can even run just a few minutes after birth.
24. Grooming
Rabbits make it a point to stay clean, so they rarely need a bath. They will groom themselves and their bonded partner a few times each day.
25. Breeding
Rabbits breed three to four times a year, but only 15% of babies make it to their first birthday. The high reproduction rate assures survival of the species.
26. Age of Reproduction
Male rabbits can start reproducing as early as 7 months, while females can get pregnant after just 4 months. A single doe and her offspring can produce roughly 800 rabbits in a single year.

27. Avoid Overpopulation
Given their high reproduction rate, overpopulation can be a big problem for rabbit pet owners. Spaying females and neutering males are among the surest ways to avoid this.
28. Easier to Train
Male rabbits have obnoxious behaviors such as spraying and frequent aggression against other rabbits. Neutering them will stop these. In addition, both spayed females and neutered males are easier to train.
29. Better Companions
Rabbits long for companionship. Male and female rabbits go well together, but the pairs are calmer without the need to breed. They become more loving and dependable.
30. Largest Rabbit Litter
The largest litter recorded for rabbits is 24. This has been achieved several times by pet rabbits in New Zealand, Canada, and Cyprus.
Characteristics
31. Baby Rabbits
The baby rabbits are called “kits” or “kittens”. These kits grow quickly. They depend on their moms for only few weeks before they start taking care of themselves.
32. Cooling Down
When it gets hot, rabbits sweat through the pads of their feet. They may also stretch their ears to cool down or fold these to stay warm.
33. Happy Rabbits
Listen closely. A content and relaxed rabbit may purr just like a cat. Meanwhile, excited rabbits may jump, twist, and kick in mid-air. Give them lots of space, toys, and food to stay happy.
34. Natural Enemies
In the wild, rabbits are keen to avoid cats, dogs, lynxes, badgers, bears, and foxes which love to hunt them. They are also on the lookout for snakes, raccoons, minks, weasels, owls, ferrets, hawks, falcons, and sparrows.

35. Communication
Rabbits can communicate through scent, such as leaving their urine and feces in certain areas to mark where they’ve been. They may also talk to each other using body postures and quiet vocalizations.
36. Habitat
Rabbits can live in different types of places thanks to adaptation. In the wild, they can be found in meadows, forests, woods, deserts, grasslands, and wetlands.
37. Anxious Bunnies
Rabbit can easily get scared and jump away, so be careful not to startle them. If you have these as pets at home, avoid picking them up or holding onto them. Be mindful of their mood.
38. Grooming
Rabbits may groom themselves obsessively, ingesting lots of fur that can lead to stomach upset. Owners can groom their rabbit weekly with a pet brush to prevent this behavior.
Unique Behaviors
39. Binky When Happy
Rabbits are expressive creatures. You will know that they are happy when they do the “binky”, a behavior in which they jump in the air, twist their body, and spin around.

40. The Trickiest Rabbit
Like other house pets, rabbit can be trained to perform tricks. The record for the most tricks in a minute is 20. It’s held by Taawi the Rabbit from Finland.
41. Underground Tunnels
In the wild, European rabbits burrow and live underground in tunnel networks called warrens. Their whiskers help them determine whether they can fit through holes so they don’t get stuck.
42. Rabbit Habitat
Wild rabbits dig burrows in a variety of habitats including woods, meadows, deserts, forests, grasslands, and wetlands. Rabbits native to southwest Europe and northwest Africa have been introduced to other locations.
43. Social Hierarchy
Rabbits have a hierarchical system. One doe will dominate all female rabbits and one buck will dominate all males. The dominant rabbits enjoy the best burrows, grooming from other rabbits, and first dibs on food.
44. Warning Signs
Rabbits are constantly on the lookout for predators. If they detect danger, they will warn others by thumping their hind legs before sheltering in a burrow.
45. Space Requirements
Rabbits will take as much space as they can get. After all, they love to run, jump, and dig. Pet cages should let them stand upright and stretch out when lying down.

46. Ideal Shelter
Since rabbits are prey animals, they get anxious out in the open. Even domesticated rabbits like having a shelter with plenty of hiding places.
47. Pet Companionship
Both wild and domesticated rabbits love companionship. If left alone, a rabbit will likely get sad and bored. Pet owners should always keep them in pairs or groups for their wellbeing.
48. Pet Preferences
Pet rabbits may allow humans to stroke their fur but they may get scared if someone picks them up. Their instinct is to think they are being captured, so don’t insist if they resist.
Rabbit Trivia
49. Cruelty-free Logo
If you are a supporter of animal rights, then look for the rabbit logo on products such as cosmetics. Its presence on the label means that the item was not tested on animals.
50. Fertility Symbol
Due to their prolific reproduction, rabbits have become a symbol of fertility among several cultures. For example, Germanic peoples worshipped the fertility goddess Eostre who is often depicted with rabbits.

51. Celtic Tradition
Celtic stories feature rabbits that can communicate with underground fairies. They also thought that some people could turn themselves into rabbits, so they did not hunt these animals.

Rabbit Vets Near Me 

This is a list of the best rabbit-savvy veterinarians for anyone looking to find a good rabbit vet in their local area. International veterinary listings are also included at the bottom of this page. Whenever possible, listings are links to local chapter vet recommendations or recommendations made by experienced rabbit rescuers or guardians.
House Rabbit Society makes NO ENDORSEMENTS regarding these veterinarians.
This rabbit vets near me list is one of the many ways that House Rabbit Society advocates for the welfare of pet rabbits. Veterinary medical schools typically do not include domestic rabbits as a required species in their core curriculum. Veterinarians interested in rabbit medicine must learn about rabbits elsewhere, such as by attending conferences and completing continuing education modules, and working with rabbit rescue groups. Our aim is to include veterinarians who have demonstrated competency with rabbit medicine and surgery, and who take the time to educate themselves.
Don’t See a Rabbit Vet’s Name on the List?
If you do not see a veterinarian’s name on the list, or if a name has disappeared, there are a few reasons why this might be:

We do not yet know enough about this veterinarian to add them to the list
No one has made up aware that the vet sees rabbits
The veterinarian doesn’t want to be on the list because they are not accepting new clients
We chose to remove the veterinarian from this list because of negative client experiences or consistently poor patient outcomes

We Encourage You To Follow-up with Your Own Research
If you are interested in using a veterinarian not on the list, please do your own careful research on the veterinarian.  Ask them questions to make sure you are comfortable taking your rabbit to them. If you would like to speak privately with us regarding any veterinarians in your chapter or region, please contact your chapter manager or local educator.
Do not assume that because one veterinarian at a clinic is experienced with rabbits, all of the doctors are. If you call for an appointment, and are offered an appointment with a vet you do not know, insist on seeing the vet you asked for. When calling, please indicate you received their veterinary listing from House Rabbit Society.
Process For Being Added to the HRS Veterinarian Listings
Please contact your local HRS chapter manager or HRS Educator for more information on being added to your area’s recommended vet list.
Local recommendations are maintained by individual chapters, or by an HRS Educator. Each chapter has their own process and criteria for deciding who is listed on their recommended vet list.

Rabbits (ウサギ, Usagi), also known as bunnies, are a species of villagers in the Animal Crossing series. They are noted for their straight, upright ears. There are twenty-two rabbit villagers, of which twelve are female and ten are male. Eight are peppy, five are lazy, two are snooty, two are jock, two are smug, one is cranky, one is normal, and one is sisterly.
Every rabbit appears in New Leaf and New Horizons, with exception of Sasha who was introduced in the Version 2.0.0 update for New Horizons.

    X Reusable Packaging   
        We at rabbit believe that the world needs better solutions to single-use packaging. That's why we now offer an alternative.
        It's called RePack - reusable and returnable delivery packaging.  
        RePack simply reduces packaging trash and saves up to 80% of CO2 emissions compared to single-use packaging.
        Add a Repack to your order for $3.50 and receive your goods in a reusable, environmentally friendly packaging.  RePack is currently only available for USA based orders and shipments. Also note that orders containing hats are not eligible to be shipped in RePacks.  YES, I want a RePack! NO, thanks
